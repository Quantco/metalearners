    "Given the fundamental problem of Causal Inference, simulating or\n",
    "generating data is of particular relevance when working with ATE or\n",
    "CATE estimation: it allows to have a ground truth that we don't get\n",
    "from the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, when generating data, we can have access to the\n",
    "Individual Treatment Effect and use that ground truth to evaluate a\n",
    "treatment effect method at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example we will describe how the modules\n",

    "- Treatment assignments\n",
    "- Observed outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular scenario of simulating data, we can add some\n",
