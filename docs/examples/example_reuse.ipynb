    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "In our {ref}`Why MetaLearners <motivation-why-metalearners>` section\n",
    "we praise the modularity of MetaLearners. Part of the reason why\n",
    "modularity is useful is because we can actively decouple different\n",
    "parts of the CATE estimation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, this decoupling allows for saving lots of compute\n",
    "resources: if we know that we merely want to change *some parts* of a\n",
    "MetaLearner, we may as well reuse the parts that we don't want to\n",
    "change. Enabling this kind of base model reuse was one of the\n",
    "requirements on ``metalearners``, see {ref}`Why not causalml or econml\n",
    "<motivation-why-not-causalml-or-econml>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, imagine trying to tune an R-Learner's -- consisting of two\n",
    "nuisance models, a propensity model and an outcome model -- propensity\n",
    "model with respect to its R-Loss. In such a scenario we would like to\n",
    "reuse the same outcome model because it isn't affected by the\n",
    "propensity model and thereby save a lot of redundant compute.\n",
