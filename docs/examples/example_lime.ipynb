    " Example: Explainability LIME plots for MetaLearners\n",
    "====================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "LIME -- short for *local interpretable model-agnostic explanations* -- is a method developed by [Ribeiro et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938).\n",
    "LIME falls under the umbrella term of explainability methods in Machine Learning. On a high level,\n",
    "it is meant to serve the purpose of providing explanations, intuitions\n",
    "or examples as to how a model or estimator works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors argue that\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the users do not trust a model or prediction, they will not use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "While LIME is typically used in supervised learning scenarios, the key\n",
    "motivation of better understanding a model's behaviour applies just as\n",
    "well to CATE estimation. Therefore, we illustrate how it can be used\n",
    "with the MetaLearner from ``metalearners``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, LIME is model-agnostic and can be used for any\n",
    "black-box model which receives features or covariates and maps those\n",
    "to a one-dimension vector of equal number of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name also suggests, the explanations provided by LIME are\n",
    "local. The authors state the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [...] for an explanation to be meaningful it must at least be locally faithful, i.e. must correspond to how the model behaves in the vicinity of the instance being predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, this means that LIME focuses on one sample -- or its\n",
    "locality/vicinity/neighborhood -- at a time and tries to imitate the\n",
    "true model behaviour around that sample with a simpler model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, LIME's objective is to choose a substitute model for\n",
    "our complex model, simulaneously considering two concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the interpretability of our new, simple model (let's call this surrogate)\n",
    "* the approximation error between the surrogate and the original,\n",
    "  complex model\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, the authors define:\n",
    "\n",
    "* {math}`f`, the original model -- in our case the MetaLearner\n",
    "* {math}`G`, the class of possible, interpretable surrogate models\n",
    "* {math}`\\Omega(g)`, a measure of complexity for {math}`g \\in G`\n",
    "* {math}`\\pi_x(z)` a proximity measure of {math}`z` with respect to data point {math}`x`\n",
    "* {math}`\\mathcal{L}(f, g, \\pi_x)` a measure of how unfaithful a {math}`g \\in G` is to {math}`f` in the locality defined by {math}`\\pi_x`\n",
    "\n",
    "Given all of these objects as well as a to be explained data point {math}`x`, the authors suggest that the most appropriate surrogate {math}`g`, also referred to as explanation for {math}`x`, {math}`\\xi(x)`, can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "  \\xi(x) = argmin_{g' \\in G} \\mathcal{L}(f, g', \\pi_x) + \\Omega(g')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors suggest a mechanisms to optimize this problem, i.e. to\n",
    "find suitable local explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, they suggest a systematic approach to selecting a set of samples, as for\n",
    "their respective local explanations to be as telling of the overall model\n",
    "behaviour as possible. Intuitively, the authors suggest to select a pool of explanations which\n",
    "\n",
    "* have little redundancy between each other\n",
    "* showcase the features with highest global importance\n",
    "\n",
    "In line with this ambition, they define a notion of 'coverage' -- to\n",
    "be maximized --as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "  c(V, W, \\mathcal{I}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{d} I[\\exists i \\in V: W_{i,j} > 0] \\mathcal{I}_j\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "* {math}`d` is the number of features\n",
    "* {math}`V` is the candidate set of explanations to be shown to\n",
    "  humans, within a fixed budget -- this is the variable to be optimized\n",
    "* {math}`W` is a {math}`n \\times d` local feature importance matrix and\n",
    "* {math}`\\mathcal{I}` is a {math}`d`-dimensional vector of global\n",
    "  feature importances\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicitly, the authors suppose that local model {math}`\\xi(x_i)` has a\n",
    "canonical way of determining feature importances for {math}`W` --\n",
    "e.g. weights in a linear model --\n",
    "and that a global model {math}`f` does so, too, for\n",
    "{math}`\\mathcal{I}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Picking data points to optimize this notion of coverage is reflected\n",
    "in ``lime``'s ``SubmodularPick`` class, which we use below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to generate LIME plots, we first need to install the [lime package](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime).\n",
    "We can do so either via conda and conda-forge:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ conda install lime -c conda-forge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or via pip and PyPI\n",
    "\n",
