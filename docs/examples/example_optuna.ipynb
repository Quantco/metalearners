    " Example: Model selection with optuna\n",
    "=========================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that model selection and/or hyperparameter optimization (HPO) can\n",
    "have massive impacts on the prediction quality in regular Machine\n",
    "Learning. Yet, it seems that model selection and hyperparameter\n",
    "optimization are  of substantial importance for CATE estimation with\n",
    "MetaLearners, too, see e.g. [Machlanski et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01412>).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, model selection and HPO for MetaLearners look quite different from what we're used to from e.g. simple supervised learning problems. Concretely,\n",
    "\n",
    "* In terms of a MetaLearners's option space, there are several levels\n",
    "  to optimize for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. The MetaLearner architecture, e.g. R-Learner vs DR-Learner\n",
    "  2. The model to choose per base estimator of said MetaLearner architecture, e.g. ``LogisticRegression`` vs ``LGBMClassifier``\n",
    "  3. The model hyperparameters per base model\n",
    "\n",
    "*  On a conceptual level, it's not clear how to measure model quality\n",
    "   for MetaLearners. As a proxy for the underlying quantity of\n",
    "   interest one might look into base model performance, the R-Loss of\n",
    "   the CATE estimates or some more elaborate approaches alluded to by\n",
    "   [Machlanski et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01412).\n",
    "\n",
    "We think that HPO can be divided into two camps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exploration of (hyperparameter, metric evaluation) pairs where the\n",
    "  pairs do not influence each other (e.g. grid search, random search)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exploration of (hyperparameter, metric evaluation) pairs where the\n",
    "  pairs do influence each other (e.g. Bayesian optimization,\n",
    "  evolutionary algorithms); in other words, there is a feedback-loop between\n",
    "  sample result and sample\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will illustrate the latter camp based on an\n",
    "application of [optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna) -- a\n",
    "popular framework for HPO -- in interplay with ``metalearners``.\n",
    "For the former please refer to the {ref}`example on hyperparameter tuning with MetaLearnerGridSearch<example-grid-search>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use ``optuna``, we first need to install the package.\n",
    "We can do so either via conda and conda-forge\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ conda install optuna -c conda-forge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or via pip and PyPI\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ pip install optuna\n",
